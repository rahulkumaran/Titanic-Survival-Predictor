# Titanic-Survival-Predictor

This was my first shot at Machine Learning. It's just a basic titanic predictor which I learnt to make by looking at a couple of sources.<br/><br/>
It predicts whether a given person survived the devastating accident or not.<br/>
Currently, it predicts it with an accuracy of 82%<br/><br/>
I'm using the RandomForestClassifier Algorithm here which I directly imported from SciKit Learn module in Python.<br/><br/>

NOTE: Runs ONLY ON PYTHON VERSIONS >= 3.3<br/>
