# Titanic-Survival-Predictor

This was my first shot at Machine Learning. It's just a basic titanic predictor which I learnt to make by looking at a couple of sources.
It predicts whether a given person survived the devastating accident or not.
Currently, it predicts it with an accuracy of 82%
I'm using the RandomForestClassifier Algorithm here which I directly imported from SciKit Learn module in Python.

NOTE: Runs ONLY ON PYTHON VERSIONS >= 3.3
